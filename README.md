# Chatbot with Googleâ€™s Gemini Pro and Streamlit

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to build a chatbot using Googleâ€™s Gemini Pro API and deploy it with Streamlit. The chatbot leverages the capabilities of large language models to engage in meaningful conversations and provide responses to user queries. The guide covers the setup of your development environment, coding the Streamlit application, and deploying the chatbot on Streamlit Cloud.

## Introduction

Large Language Models (LLMs) like Googleâ€™s Gemini Pro can understand and generate human-like text, making them ideal for chatbot development. Streamlit allows for easy creation of interactive web applications. This guide will help you integrate these technologies to build and deploy a functional chatbot.

## Getting Started

1. **Obtain an API Key from Google Gemini Pro:**
   - Visit [Google AI Studio](https://ai.google).
   - Create a new project.
   - Generate an API key.
   - Save the API key securely.

2. **Set Up Your Development Environment:**
   - Install Python on your machine.
   - Set up a virtual environment using `venv`.
   - Install necessary libraries with `pip`.

## Setting Up the Development Environment

Create a project structure with the following files:

- `main.py`: The main application file.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists all dependencies.
- `.env`: Stores your API key.

Install the required libraries:

```bash
pip install streamlit python-dotenv google-generative-ai
```

## Writing the Streamlit Application

1. **Import Required Libraries**:

   ```python
   import streamlit as st
   import os
   from dotenv import load_dotenv
   from google.generative_ai import ChatGPT
   ```

2. **Load Environment Variables**:

   ```python
   load_dotenv()
   API_KEY = os.getenv("GOOGLE_API_KEY")
   ```

3. **Configure the Streamlit App**:

   ```python
   st.set_page_config(page_title="Chat with Gemini Pro", page_icon="ðŸ§ ", layout="centered")
   ```

4. **Create Chat Functionality**:

   ```python
   def get_response(prompt):
       response = ChatGPT.generate_response(prompt, api_key=API_KEY)
       return response
   ```

5. **Maintain Chat History**:

   ```python
   if "history" not in st.session_state:
       st.session_state.history = []
   ```

6. **Display Chat Messages**:

   ```python
   for msg in st.session_state.history:
       st.write(msg)
   ```

7. **Create User Input Field**:

   ```python
   user_input = st.text_input("Ask Gemini Pro:")
   if user_input:
       response = get_response(user_input)
       st.session_state.history.append(f"You: {user_input}")
       st.session_state.history.append(f"Gemini Pro: {response}")
   ```

## Testing the Application Locally

Run your application locally with:

```bash
streamlit run main.py
```

Navigate to the provided local URL in your web browser to interact with your chatbot.

## Deploying Your Chatbot on Streamlit Cloud

1. **Create a Public Repository on GitHub:**
   - Upload your project files.
   - Ensure the `.env` file is configured correctly.

2. **Deploy on Streamlit Cloud:**
   - Sign in to Streamlit Cloud using your GitHub account.
   - Create a new app and link it to your GitHub repository.
   - Deploy the app and wait for the process to complete.

   After deployment, you will receive a URL to access your chatbot online.
